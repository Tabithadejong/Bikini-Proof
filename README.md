# Bikini-Proof

Bikini Proof is a website for women that want to get into shape. As the title suggests the parameter for this is to what extent they feel comfortable and confident in a bikini. As we know this is not the case for many women, we offer packages that exist out of fitness and diet coaching with the purpose of becoming bikini fit aka Bikini Proof.
